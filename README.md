# Data-512-Final-Project

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to look at masking data and understand how it affected the course of COVID in Jefferson County, KY. The project was broken into 4 parts:

- Assignment A4: A Common Analysis that sets the stage for the subsequent assignments. In A4 we conduct a base analysis. 
- Assignment A5: Extends the A4 analysis, by looking at the masking data + confirmed cases through the lens of human centered data science. In my analysis, I look specifically at park mobility data
- Assignment A6: Presentation
- Assignment A7: Final Report
